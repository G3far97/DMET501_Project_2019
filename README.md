🎨 3D Modeling and Animation Project
 This repository showcases my 3D modeling and animation project created as part of the DMET 501 - Introduction to Media Engineering course at the German University in Cairo (GUC) during Winter 2019. The project features a Minion character modeled and animated using Autodesk Maya, along with a static HTML & CSS website to present the final output.

📋 Project Overview
As per the assignment, the objective was to:
	1.	Model a 3D character based on a 2D design using Autodesk Maya.
	2.	Apply textures and create a fully-rendered version of the character.
	3.	Animate two specific motions for the model:
    	•	Arm Waving
    	•	Head Tilting
	4.	Build a static website to display the project, embedding an animation video as the deliverable.
	5.	Deploy the website using GitHub Pages for public access.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
	•	Autodesk Maya: For 3D modeling, texturing, and animation.
	•	HTML & CSS: For building the static website.
	•	GitHub Pages: For hosting and deploying the project online.

📁 Repository Structure
The repository contains the following key folders and files:
	•	assets/: Includes project resources such as:
	•	Animation video file.
	•	GUC and course-related documents.
	•	index.html: The main webpage for presenting the project.
	•	style.css: Styling file for the webpage.

🌟 Features
	•	3D Minion Model: Fully textured and rigged character.
	•	Dynamic Animations: Two motions (arm waving and head tilting) showcase the character’s fluidity.
	•	Responsive Webpage: A simple, visually appealing website built with HTML & CSS to present the project.
	•	Live Deployment: Access the website live via GitHub Pages.

🌐 Live Deployment
The project is deployed on GitHub Pages and can be accessed here: https://g3far97.github.io/DMET501_Project_2019/

🚀 How to Use Locally
	1.	Clone or download the repository.
	2.	Open the index.html file in any modern web browser.
	3.	Explore the static webpage and view the embedded animation video.

📹 Project Demo
The animation video is embedded within the webpage and can be viewed directly on the deployed website or after opening index.html.

🎓 Learning Outcomes
This project enhanced my proficiency in:
	•	3D Modeling & Animation: Creating textured models and smooth animations in Autodesk Maya.
	•	Web Development: Building and styling a static webpage to showcase technical outputs.
	•	Creative & Technical Integration: Merging animation and web development to deliver a comprehensive project.
	•	Deployment: Hosting projects on GitHub Pages to make them accessible to the public.
